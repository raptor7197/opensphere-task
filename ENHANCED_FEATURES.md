# 🚀 Enhanced Visa Evaluation System

## ✅ **Major Improvements Implemented**

### 1. **🎯 Realistic Evaluation Algorithm**
**Problem:** Previous system gave unrealistic high scores regardless of qualifications
**Solution:** Implemented strict, hierarchical scoring based on actual visa requirements

#### **New Scoring Hierarchy:**
1. **📚 Education (35 points)** - MOST CRITICAL
   - PhD: 35 points (if meets requirements) / 20 points (if exceeds)
   - Master's: 30 points / 15 points
   - Bachelor's: 25 points / 10 points
   - Professional Cert: 15 points / 5 points
   - High School: 5 points (usually disqualifying)

2. **💼 Work Experience (25 points)** - SECOND MOST CRITICAL
   - 10+ years: 25 points
   - 5-9 years: 20 points
   - 3-4 years: 15 points
   - 1-2 years: 10 points
   - 0 years: 0 points

3. **💰 Salary (20 points)** - THIRD MOST CRITICAL
   - 150%+ of minimum: 20 points
   - 120-149%: 16 points
   - 100-119%: 12 points
   - 80-99%: 6 points
   - Below 80%: 0 points

4. **🏢 Sponsor Status (10 points)** - MAJOR ADVANTAGE
   - Recognized sponsor: +10 points + 15% final score boost
   - Regular employer: +3 points
   - No sponsor: 0 points

#### **Realistic Score Caps:**
- ❌ **Education doesn't meet requirements:** Max 35%
- ❌ **Salary below minimum:** Max 45%
- ❌ **Insufficient experience:** Max 40%
- ✅ **Perfect candidate:** Max 75% (realistic ceiling)

### 2. **⏳ Professional Loading Screen**

**Solution:** Added comprehensive loading experience with progress tracking

#### **Features:**
- **📊 6-stage progress indicator**

  5. AI evaluation
  6. Generating results

  - Prevents instant/fake impression

### 3. **🤖 Enhanced AI Integration**

**Solution:** Contextual prompts considering visa-specific requirements

#### **Improvements:**
- **Visa-specific requirements analysis**
- **Country-specific minimum thresholds**
- **Education level hierarchy enforcement**
- **Experience requirement validation**
- **Sponsor status consideration**

**Solution:** Context-aware recommendations based on specific gaps

#### **Smart Recommendations:**
- **Education:** Specific degree requirements
- **Experience:** Exact years needed
- **Salary:** Minimum threshold amounts
